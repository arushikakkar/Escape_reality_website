 <h3>BORED OF THE SAME OLD TRIPS OUT WITH WORK? WHY NOT ORGANISE 
 AN <span style="font-weight: 600; color: #e74c3c;">ESCAPE ROOM TEAM 
 BUILDING</span> TRIP TO ESCAPE REALITY?</h3>
 <div class="border"></div>
 <div class="box77"><p>When looking through the list of all the escape games that you could play, there are so many different and unusual scenarios that you could throw your co-workers into. You could put your colleagues behind bars in the infamous prison Alcatraz or ask them to find and capture an evil Vampire named Nosferatu. How about testing their skills of deception and seeing if they can steal an expensive painting in The Heist? If none of those options take your fancy, then they could face their fears in any of our horror themed rooms or become expert detectives in some of our adventure themed rooms.</p>
 <p>As an unusual team building activity, teams of between 2-6 players are locked within a themed room for sixty minutes and must work together to find and solve the challenging puzzles. Players will have to think creatively and interact together in a neutral environment, out of the workplace, in their attempts to escape the room. You could think of escape rooms as an excellent form of alternative entertainment. Fun for all ages and abilities, they are a truly unique and exciting activity promoting teamwork and communication.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="box8">
 <p>What can you expect during your escape room team building activity? Large groups will be divided into smaller teams and split between multiple different rooms. This creates a sense of competition between colleagues as they race against each other to be victorious. The experience generates a strong sense of teamwork and brings to light different group dynamics highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of members within the team. A successful escape can create a great sense of achievement and bring players closer together as a stronger team.</p>
 <p>You can build your own escape room experience by deciding which rooms you would want to play, and exactly when you want to play them. Each of our locations have numerous different rooms to choose from, all with themes varying from horror and thriller to adventure. Depending upon the location you wish to visit, we can offer bespoke packages to make your time with us even better. These special additions could include an offering of catering options, full exclusivity of the building and bar area, or access to our onsite conference rooms which are available in select locations. Just get in touch with the branch you would like to visit to see what we can offer!</p>

 <h4>WHAT BENEFITS CAN BE GAINED FROM PLAYING ESCAPE GAMES?</h4>
 <div class="border"></div>
 <h6>Well, immersing co-workers into a completely neutral and unusual environment 
 is a positive thing and a unique team building activity. There are many benefits 
 to real escape rooms which will become evident as soon as everyone returns to the 
 office or workplace.</h6>
 <div class="box9"><h2>IMPROVES COOPERATION</h2>
 <p>Being immersed inside an unusual and non-traditional environment, away from the 
 office, can vastly improve relationships. Different dynamics of individuals and how 
 personalities can work together will come to the forefront as people find their place 
 within the group. The situation almost exposes potentially hidden characteristics as 
 individuals are in a situation where they cannot hide behind the comfort of their desk. 
 It exposes both the strengths and weaknesses of individuals and how they can take these 
 from each other, combine them and make an effective team.</p></div>
 <div class="box10"><img src="images/corpsmall-2.jpg"></div>
 <div class="border1"></div>
 <div class="box9"><h2>IMPROVES CO WORKER RELATIONS</h2>
 <p>Within an escape room, team building activities take on a different form. The 
 setting breaks down social barriers and allow co-workers to mix with different people, 
 such as those who may not be in their department, or by mixing staff members with other 
 managers. This means that bonds and relationships may be strengthened. Any conflicts 
 between employees will be put aside when everyone has the same objective – to escape 
 the room in time! The time deadline will expose who can work better under pressure and 
 calm each other down or reveal those who are a calming influence.</p></div>
 <div class="box10"><img src="images/corpsmall-1.jpg"></div>
 <div class="border2"></div>
 <div class="box9"><h2>IMPROVES CREATIVE THINKING</h2>
 <p>When playing an escape room, team building ideas that are monotonous quickly become 
 a thing of the past. Attempts to escape from the room demands the need for creative 
 thinking as the puzzles and mysteries players will have to overcome will differ 
 enormously from those faced in the workplace. The puzzle solving process may not be 
 what is expected, and players will have to combine their logistical thinking in order 
 to solve the puzzles in a quick and efficient manner. Everything players see could be 
 viewed as a potential clue and things may not be as they first seem.</p></div>
